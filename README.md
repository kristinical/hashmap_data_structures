# hashmap_data_structures
#### Portfolio assignment for CS 261: Data Structures course at Oregon State University

This assignment implements a HashMap in two forms (by completing the provided skeleton code):
1. Separate Chaining with singly linked lists
2. Open Addressing with quadratic probing

Methods implemented for both Separate Chaining AND Open Addressing include:
* put()
* empty_buckets()
* table_load()
* clear()
* resize_table()
* get()
* contains_key()
* remove()
* get_keys_and_values()
  
Method implemented for Separate Chaining ONLY:
* find_mode()

Methods implemented for Open Addressing ONLY:
* iter()
* next()
